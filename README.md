# caseXwhen

So in SQL, when creating a new varaible that has logic in it you can do case when
```SQL
select *,
case when var1="a" then "a1"
    when var1="b "then "b1"
    when var1="c" then "c1"
    else missing end as var2
from dummy;
```

each of the when statements can have more complex logic like in the r case when statement but in this case where there is something that is incredibly repetetive and is only based on equality you can do

```SQL
select *,
case var1 when "a" then "a1"
          when "b" then "b1"
          when "c" then "c1"
          else missing end as var2
from dummy;
```

now in r we can do the same with case when
```r
dummy %>% mutate(var2=case_when(var1=="a"~"a1"
                                var1=="b"~"b1",
                                var1=="c"~"c1"))
```
but you I havenâ€™t see the solution where you can specify the input and then the mapping to do it quicker.

This leads to the function casexwhen where you specify of a vector input and mapping for speedier coding.
